# **MVP Simulation Tool**  

### **SlavkoKernel v7 — Institutional Specification Extension**

**Status:** GOVERNED  
**Protocol:** SLAVKO‑V7‑ORCHESTRATION  
**Specification Authority:** `INSTITUTIONAL_SPECIFICATION_v1.0.md`  
**Classification:** REPUTATIONAL ARTEFACT

---

## **1. Purpose**

The MVP Simulation Tool is an institutional orchestration surface designed to evaluate early‑stage startup hypotheses under deterministic, versioned, and reputationally governed conditions.  
Its outputs are formal **Verdicts**, not exploratory calculations.

This artefact extends **SlavkoKernel v7**, inheriting its deterministic execution model, governance constraints, and idempotent simulation doctrine.

---

## **2. System Architecture**

The system implements the **Triple‑Engine Architecture**, a governed evaluation model that decomposes startup viability into three institutional dimensions:

### **2.1 Market Validation Engine (MVE)**  

**Domain:** Narrative Strength  
**Function:** Quantifies validation signals, lead quality, and early‑market resonance.  
**Output:** Market Validation Score (MVS)

### **2.2 Financial Projection Engine (FPE)**  

**Domain:** Economic Mechanics  
**Function:** Computes pricing dynamics, CAC structure, revenue potential, and financial resilience.  
**Output:** Financial Projection Score (FPS)

### **2.3 Growth & Confidence Engine (GCE)**  

**Domain:** Risk Horizon  
**Function:** Evaluates churn exposure, time horizon, and confidence stability.  
**Output:** Growth Confidence Score (GCS)

### **2.4 Verdict Synthesis Layer**  

The three engines feed into a deterministic synthesis layer that produces:

- **GO / NO‑GO Verdict**  
- **Credit Rating (AAA → CCC)**  
- **Institutional Summary Block**

All synthesis logic is version‑locked and governed.

## **3. Determinism & Governance**

The system adheres to the following institutional constraints:

### **3.1 Idempotency**  

Identical inputs must always produce identical outputs.  
No randomness. No nondeterminism. No accidental motion.

### **3.2 Versioned Logic**  

All computational logic is explicitly versioned and traceable.  
Changes require specification updates and governed review.

### **3.3 Institutional Output Standard**  

All outputs must be:

- deterministic  
- reproducible  
- reputationally safe  
- aligned with the Institutional Specification  

### **3.4 Observability**  

Analytics events (PostHog) are emitted through governed hooks for:

- simulation start  
- simulation completion  
- verdict issuance  

No user‑identifying data is collected.

## **4. Deployment Specification**

### **4.1 Target Platform**  

**Cloudflare Pages** — governed edge deployment.

### **4.2 Build Command**

```
npm run build
```

### **4.3 Output Directory**

```
.next
```

### **4.4 Repository Requirements**

- Clean commit history  
- No commented code  
- TypeScript‑strict compliance  
- Institutional documentation present (`FORMATDISC_DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md`, `README.md`)  

---

## **5. Operational Guarantees**

The system guarantees:

- deterministic simulation flow  
- audit‑grade UI stability  
- zero layout shift (CLS‑locked)  
- governed state transitions  
- institutional error boundaries  

---

## **6. Credit Rating Module**

The credit rating logic is implemented as a standalone governed module:

```
lib/credit-rating.ts
```

It maps simulation outputs to institutional credit ratings (AAA → CCC) using deterministic thresholds defined in the specification.

---

## **7. Institutional Artefacts**

The following artefacts are required for compliance:

- **INSTITUTIONAL_SPECIFICATION_v1.0.md**  
- **FORMATDISC_DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md**  
- **README.md (governed edition)**  
- **SlavkoKernel v7 compliance header**  

All artefacts must be maintained as reputational documents.

---

## **8. Extension Surfaces**

The system supports the following governed extensions:

### **8.1 PDF Export Module**  

Institutional PDF containing:

- Verdict  
- Credit Rating  
- Executive Financial Brief  
- FormatDisc watermark  

### **8.2 SimulationChamber**  

Ceremonial entrypoint for simulation initiation.

### **8.3 Production Analytics Integration**  

Governed PostHog instrumentation.
